'''
In order to do arithmetics operations on python, there are severals symbols that
are going to be used.
They are the following: 
    sum > +
    minus > -
    multiplication > *
    division > /
    low division > //
    exponent > **
    module > % 
'''

# All values can be seen with the debugger, looking in local variables
sum = 1 + 1
minus = 8 - 3

multi = 2 * 2
div = 4 / 2 # type(div) = float

low_div = 4 // 3 # type(low_div) = int

exponent = 3 ** 2

module = 2 % 3
