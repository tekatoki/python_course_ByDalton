'''
In order to compare the value of any variable on python there are several operators
to set an statement to see whether the condition we have setted is true or false.

The operators available on python are the following:
    == > {a} is equal to {b}
    != > {a} is not equal to {b}

    <  > {a} is less than {b} # ONLY type(int OR float)
    <= > {a} is less or equal to {b} # ONLY type(int OR float)

    >  > {a} is more than {b} # ONLY type(int OR float)
    >= > {a} is more or equal to {b} # ONLY type(int OR float) 
'''

equal_to = 3 == 3 # True

not_equal_to = 3 != 3 # False

less_than = 3 < 2 # False

less_or_equal_to = 3 <= 3 # True

greater_than = 8 > 4 # True

greater_or_equal_to = 3 >= 5 # False
