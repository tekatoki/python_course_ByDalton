''' 
There are some ways to create tuples on python.
It's also important to mention that tuples are a very useful type of data
when it comes to create inmutable variables that are only-read. This is due to data 
management.

# Using function tuple()
tuple_function = tuple(['list', 'tuple', 'dictionary'])

# Using only comma 
tuple_comma = 'dot', 'comma', 2.23
tuple_one = 'this will only have one value',
